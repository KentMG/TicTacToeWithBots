Tic-Tac-Toe with Bots

This is a web served version of TicTacToe.  When opened it offers the choice of 1 or 2 players. If one player is chosen then the player is given the choice of playing as X or as O and the bot will play as the other one. Upon the end of the game the player will be given the choice of replaying the game with the same options
